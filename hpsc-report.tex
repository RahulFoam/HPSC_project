\section*{Problem Definition}
A 2D Cartesian $(x,y)$ computational domain of size $L=1m$ and $H=1m$, for computational heat advection of a fluid ($\rho=1000\frac{Kg}{m^3}$ and $C_p=4180\frac{W}{mK}$) moving with a uniform velocity $u=v=1\frac{m}{s}$ and an initial temperature of 50C. The left and top boundary of the domain is subjected to 100C and the bottom and right boundary to 0C. Using the physics based finite volume solution methodology, developed a computer program for the above problem, and ran the code for First Order Upwind scheme(FOU). We varied the maximum number of grid points in x-and y-direction in the range of 102 to 1002 and convergence criteria as 20000 iterations.
